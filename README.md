#A Tour of America's Ludicrous Laws
This game was inspired by an article that a friend recently sent around highlighting some of the crazy laws in the country that you'd never believe were real.  We all had a fun time going through them, picking out our favorites and learning a little weird trivia about our home states as well.

I wanted to take this fun content and turn it into an interactive learning adventure, and hence this game was born.

##The Build

This game was built from the ground up using the following tools:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Bootstrap
- jQuery

I leaned on my confidence in building and styling dynamic pages and manipulating the DOM to provide a unique experience for each game, and pushed myself to pick up new knowledge along the way including a continuous call and reset of the animate function.

##Next Steps

I'd like to re-incorporate user input fields to capture each player's name and feed that into the game, and also provide a little more help for the player by inserting optional hints for each question.  I'd also like to incorporate more & quicker animation for a more fluid game experience to keep the momentum while playing.

##Thanks for playing!
